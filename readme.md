In 1986 Craign Reynolds coined the term boids. He defined the as generic simulated flocking creatures.
The boids move according to three rules i.e.

1. Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
2. Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
3. Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates
